<p><strong>MHacks 9, Michigan university - Project Air - C2's Best Hack for Air Traffic Control 
</strong>
<br><br>
Project: Worked in a team of 4 to develop an air traffic controller simulation using a HTC Vive and Unity Game Engine, Firebase Database, and an Amazon Echo for voice control
<br><br>
Contribution: 
Wrote design documentation for C2's sponsor prize 
Developed c# scripts for a unity based virtual reality project 
<br><br>
<strong>SpartaHacks, Michigan State University - ClawBoi - TOP 10 Hack
</strong>
<br><br>

Project: A small scale robotic claw arm that was controlled via a gyroscope for spatial motion and a potentiometer for opening and closing the claw and was controlled using an Arduino microcontroller
<br><br>

Contributions: 
Designed and built the mechanical platform a small scale robotic arm
Handled Wiring for the arms actuators  
<br><br>
<strong>CWRUHacks, Case Western Reserve University - VR Glove - Runner Up, Best Hardware Hack, Best STEM Education for Women, Best Startup Pitch</strong>
<br><br>

Project: A pair of gloves that used 5 accelerometers(one on each finger) and a Arduino with a bluetooth shield sewn to each glove to track hand motion. These gloves were paired with HTC Vive wrist trackers to then translate the users hands into a VR world, we then utilized the VR gloves to create a VR game that used the gloves to allow for users to grab and throw objects.
